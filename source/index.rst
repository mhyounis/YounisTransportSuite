Younis Radiation Physics Suite
==============================

Younis Radiation Physics Suite (YRPS) is a collection of codes that are focused on radiation transport. Lionbolt is a Fortran program which, given physics data, can perform deterministic space-angle solves of the Boltzmann transport equation. NittanyPhysics is a Fortran library which can discretize the physics of, at the moment, photons and electrons (energy range 100 eV - ??? MeV), under the multigroup approximation. Finally, Terpdose is a python module which can extract, process, and plot the .h5 files put out by Lionbolt.
